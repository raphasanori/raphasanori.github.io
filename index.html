If I needed to describe all my interests I couldn't really sum up them easily, but some main ones are linguistics, computer graphics, game development and software engineering in general.<br/>
<br/>
On the <b>linguistics field</b>, I have a good experience with translation <b>ENG ↔ PT</b> including commercial games for big platforms (like the Nintendo Switch) and ongoing games for big companies (like <a href="https://www.koggames.com/" target="_blank">KOG Games</a>). I also participated in a variety of community efforts to broad the reach of good content (like creating subtitles for educational YouTube videos). I can translate almost anything, highly specialized vocabulary of an unknown area may be a challenge, however not an obstacle if the time constraints allow.<br/>
<br/>
On the <b>computer science field</b>, I have experience with C/C++ and some other low level languages, assembly programming for X86 and ARM platforms, graphical programming using OpenGL, data packaging for deployment of products and computer vision under limited resources (on embedded computers).<br/>
<br/>
On the <b>artistic side of things</b>, I have a hobby of drawing, but I don't really consider myself good yet. And I also have some experience with web design! Like the page you are looking at right now :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah! My current academic degree is Bachelor of Technology in Computer Systems Analysis and Development!
